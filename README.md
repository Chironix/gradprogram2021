This is the master repo for the Chironix 2021 Graduate Program's problem.

# It Contains:
    0. What's this even for?
    1. The "Finders Keepers" problem
    2. The "Creepy Stalker" problem
    3. Some helpful notes, links and hints
    4. Specifics about deployment (i.e your restrictions)


## How did I get here?
    * (www.chironix.com)[Go here.]

## FINDERS KEEPERS
  * Students will create a robotic solution which can autonomously navigate the Chironix lab [An Environment unknown] to find specific objects[Known].
  * Grading will be based on the following criteria:
      [] Reliability of the solution - how often does it crash (program) and how often does it crash (the robot)
      [] Number of objects identified.
      [] Sophistication of object identification solutions (ML/Cameras/features etc)
      [] Number of collisions with obstacles in the environment if any, and, unexplained behaviour vs explained behaviour

## CREEPY STALKER
  * Students will create a tracking solution for one robot to follow another robot - a dynamic task tracking and navigation task in an [Environment unknown] setting.
  * Grading will be based on the following criteria:
      [] Reliability of the solution - how often does it crash (program) and how often does it crash (the robot)
      [] Reliability of the solution to track a given target
      [] Sophistication of object identification solutions (ML/Cameras/features etc)
      [] Number of collisions with obstacles in the environment if any, and, unexplained behaviour vs explained behaviour

## NOTES:
  * Chironix will supply a gazebo environment for the appropriate platform.
  * Chironix will grade entries from DDMMYY to DDMMYY.
  * Announcing finalists between DDMMYY and DDMMYY.
  * Finalists will have a chance to jump on a VC with Chironix Engineers to ensure smooth deployment, this session will be time limited, parties unable to get their entry deployed may be eliminated.
  * Conducting final rounds on our real hardware in our lab from DDDMMYY.
  * Announcing winners DDMMYY.
  * A list of helpful lidar resources is here. [#TODO: Add resources]
  * A list of helpful vision resources. [#TODO: Add resources]
  * URDFs are in the repos.
  * Submit via [PR](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
  * Getting started instructions are in the folders enclosed.
