# footprint: [[-0.21, -0.165], [-0.21, 0.165], [0.21, 0.165], [0.21, -0.165]] # Footprint is the contour of the mobile base.
# In ROS, it is represented by a two-dimensional array of the form [x0, y0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...].
# This footprint will be used to compute the radius of inscribed circles and circumscribed circles, which are used to
# inflate obstacles in a way that fits this robot. Usually, for safety, we want to have the footprint be slightly larger
# than the robotâ€™s real contour.
footprint_padding: 0.01 # Provides safety margin to help prevent collisions with nearby objects, and to restrict how
# narrow a corridor the robot is allowed into.

robot_base_frame: base_link # The name of the frame for the base link of the robot.

##The following parameters can be changed individually for the global and local costmaps
update_frequency: 4.0 # The frequency in Hz for the map to be updated.
publish_frequency: 3.0 # The frequency in Hz for the map to be publish display information.
transform_tolerance: 0.5

resolution: 0.1 # The resolution of the map in meters/cell. 0.05

obstacle_range: 5.5 # The default maximum distance from the robot at which an obstacle will be inserted into the cost map in meters.
raytrace_range: 6.0 # The default range in meters at which to raytrace out obstacles from the map using sensor data.
